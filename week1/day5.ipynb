      "Today, we are excited to launch ùëáùëüùëéùëêùëòùëñùëú, a lightweight experiment tracking and visualization library ‚Äî written in <1,000 lines of Python ‚Äî that is completely open-source, 100% free to use, locally or hosted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why did we create an experiment tracking library when others exist? 3 reasons:\n",
      "\n",
      "üéØ Extensibility: libraries for experiment tracking often are not extensible: if you want to want or add a feature, track something completely new, or change the UI, you can't easily do it since the hosted piece is closed-source or at least not written in Python. Trackio is not a walled garden ‚Äî fork it and change the Python code however you need and it'll work fine.\n",
      "\n",
      "üéØ Local-first: You shouldn't need an account just to track and visualize metrics! We wanted to give ML practitioners a local-first option that allowed them to  track metrics privately. Of course, If you want to persist the logs or share the dashboard with others, you have the option to do that through Hugging Face datasets/Spaces with a single line of code.\n",
      "\n",
      "üéØ FREE: did we mention that Trackio is free to use, even for hosted dashboards?\n",
      "\n",
      "It also comes with a familiar API so you can start using it immediately!\n",
